# Algo-Sorting
This is the first project for Algorithms class. We are to implement four different sorting algorithms and compare their time taken.

The best of the four sorting algorithms I tested was by far Quicksort. Conversely the absolute worst was Bubble sort. These findings can be seen
in the screenshots provided below.
